<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>
  A world where humanity has been driven to the brink of extinction and lives
  within three enormous concentric walls to protect themselves from giant,
  man-eating humanoid creatures known as Titans. The series begins with a
  century of peace, during which the main characters—Eren Yeager, his adopted
  sister Mikasa Ackerman, and their best friend Armin Arlert—live a seemingly
  normal life in the outermost wall, Wall Maria. This fragile peace is violently
  shattered by the sudden appearance of the Colossal Titan, a gargantuan
  creature that breaches the wall, allowing other Titans to swarm inside. In the
  chaos that follows, Eren witnesses a Titan devour his mother, sparking a
  deep-seated hatred and a burning desire for revenge. This traumatic event sets
  him on a path to join the Scout Regiment, an elite military branch that
  ventures beyond the walls, with the sole purpose of exterminating every last
  Titan.

<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>
  Naruto Uzumaki, a boisterous, orphaned, and lonely young boy living in the
  Hidden Leaf Village. Twelve years before the story begins, a powerful
  nine-tailed fox demon attacked the village, and the Fourth Hokage, the
  village's leader, sacrificed his life to seal the demon inside a newborn
  Naruto. As a result, Naruto is ostracized and feared by the villagers, who see
  him not as a hero but as the monster itself. Desperate for attention and
  recognition, Naruto often acts out by pulling pranks and causing mischief, but
  his true dream is to become the next Hokage and finally earn the respect and
  admiration of everyone in his village.

<h3>Dragon Ball Z</h3>
<p>
  Goku, five years after the events of "Dragon Ball," now a grown man and the
  father of a young boy named Gohan. The peaceful life he has built is shattered
  by the arrival of a powerful, long-lost brother named Raditz. Raditz reveals
  to Goku that he is not from Earth but is a Saiyan, a member of a nearly
  extinct warrior race that sent him to destroy the planet. After kidnapping
  Gohan to coerce Goku into joining him, Raditz's immense power forces Goku to
  form an unlikely alliance with his former rival, Piccolo. The two must work
  together in a desperate attempt to defeat this formidable new foe and save the
  world.
